This is the release and very early beta of my new Galacticraft Addon. Every planet that will be added is a confirmed Exoplanet that is documented in the NASA's Exoplanet Archive.

The addon will also feature material aimed at education into Astronomy. And other features and ideas that are not yet implemented.

#### **Solar Systems & Planets**

**Please Note: Right now the planets are barren, no Ores or Materials have been added yet. When this Note is removed, that is when any ores or features will appear on planets**

-   **Yz Ceti** (2/3 Planets Implemented)
-   Upsilon Andromedae (Removed)
-   **Wolf 1061** (Not Yet Implemented)
-   **HD 219134** (Not Yet Implemented)
-   **Gliese 676 A** (Removed)
-   **Trappist 1** (Not Yet Implemented)

* This will not be an addon where planets or solar systems will remain non-implemented. The point is to create unique planets which will take take (that and terrain generation isn't my strong point yet)

####   
**Future Planned Features**

-   Rockets (maybe?)
-   Planet Specific Minerals and/or Materials
-   Add additional machines for space / research
-   Futuristic / Space / Tech themed blocks
-   A research system that uses real world applications of detecting planets
-   Research using real data from Exoplanet data archives
-   And more once i figure some things out

The orbits, solar systems sizes will be the best representation of their true size and planetary distance. As well as planets biomes and terrain.

However, because of the actual size of some solar systems in comparison to Sol, their actual size cannot be accurate in comparison to the size

Galcticraft shows Sol,

Example: The Trappist 1 system, even though this system has 7 planets in total, the entire system radius wouldn't even reach the orbit of mercury

if it was superimposed over our system

#### **Addon Compatibility**

One of the goals i set out when creating just the rough draft of this addon was compatibility with other Galacticraft Addons. I as well have suffered the pain of trying to run multiple addons and having to go through the process of trial and error of changing configs. (Note: this is not a bash at the other addon devs at any level)

The highest goal of any full release of the mod is to be compatible with every other addon without the need to change any configs on this addon.
